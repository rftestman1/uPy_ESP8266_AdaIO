# Seedgistics Tower Monitor
MicroPython file used to control the Seedgistics Tower Monitor control unit
  
## Requirements
In order to run this you will need to set up some sort of IDE with a connection to a ESP8266 board. I suggest using this manual [here](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2018/01/micropython-plugin-for-pycharm/ "PyCharm + ESP8266")
  

## How to build
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

## How to run
```bash
python main.py
```
